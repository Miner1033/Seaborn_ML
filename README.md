📊 Seaborn Data Visualization Project



This repository showcases various data visualization projects using Seaborn, a Python visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. Seaborn is designed for making statistical graphics more accessible and visually appealing.

📚 Overview
Seaborn simplifies the creation of attractive and informative statistical graphics. It provides a high-level interface for drawing plots, making it easy to explore and understand your data. This repository demonstrates how to use Seaborn for tasks such as statistical plotting, customizations, and creating various types of visualizations.

✨ Features
📈 Plotting Basics: Line, bar, box, violin, pairplot, and other statistical plots.
🎨 Customizing Plots: Adjusting colors, themes, labels, and styles to enhance readability.
📊 Complex Plots: Creating heatmaps, correlation plots, and pairwise comparisons.
🧑‍💻 Integration with Pandas: Easily integrate Seaborn with data frames for seamless data visualization.
📈 Regression Plots: Visualizing linear relationships and fitting regression models to data.
🔍 Statistical Analysis: Plotting distributions, statistical tests, and uncertainty intervals.
🚀 Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/seaborn-data-visualization.git
cd seaborn-data-visualization
Install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
💻 Usage
Here's an example of using Seaborn to create a simple scatter plot with a regression line:

python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load a sample dataset from Seaborn
data = sns.load_dataset('tips')

# Create a scatter plot with a regression line
sns.regplot(x='total_bill', y='tip', data=data)

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Total Bill')
plt.ylabel('Tip Amount')
plt.title('Scatter Plot with Regression Line')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
